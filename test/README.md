# Test Input and Output Data

Two directories in this directory, `input_data` and `output_data`, are used to interact with the test code.

`input_data` contains the test data required for testing.  
These files are too big to be committed to the repository, so it is your responsibility to provide them if you want to run the tests.

`output_data` contains any files output from the tests, for human inspection.

See below for specifications of what files are required/output for each test type.

## Non-MPI unit tests

TODO: explain in here what test input files need to be present for each unit test.

## MPI unit tests

These tests do not require any input data, and do not output any data.

## Integration tests

TODO: explain in here what test input files need to be present for integration tests.
